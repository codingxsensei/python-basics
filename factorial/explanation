Explanation of the Factorial Calculation Code

Assign a value to n:
The variable n is assigned the value 5. This indicates that the factorial of 5 will be calculated.

Initialize the factorial variable:
The variable factorial is initialized to 1 because starting with 1 ensures that subsequent multiplications calculate the factorial correctly. (Multiplying by 1 does not affect the result.)

Set up a loop:
A for loop is used to iterate through numbers from 1 to n (inclusive). The range of numbers generated by the loop ensures that all integers from 1 to n are considered for multiplication.

Multiply during each iteration:
In each iteration of the loop, the current number is multiplied by the value of factorial. The result is stored back into factorial, effectively accumulating the product of all numbers from 1 to n.

Print the result:
Once the loop is complete, the calculated factorial value is displayed. This gives the final product of all numbers from 1 to n.

Example Calculation:
If n = 5:

Initial value: factorial = 1.

Iteration 1: Multiply 1 by 1. Result: factorial = 1.

Iteration 2: Multiply 1 by 2. Result: factorial = 2.

Iteration 3: Multiply 2 by 3. Result: factorial = 6.

Iteration 4: Multiply 6 by 4. Result: factorial = 24.

Iteration 5: Multiply 24 by 5. Result: factorial = 120.

Output:

The final output is 120, which is the factorial of 5.

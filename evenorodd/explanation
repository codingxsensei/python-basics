Explanation of Each Line:

x = int(input("Enter any number: "))
The input() function displays a prompt to the user ("Enter any number: ") and waits for input.
The int() function converts the input (which is a string by default) into an integer.
The integer value is assigned to the variable x.

if x % 2 == 0:
The % operator calculates the remainder when x is divided by 2.
If the remainder is 0, the number is even.
The condition x % 2 == 0 evaluates to True for even numbers.

print("Even")
If the condition in the if statement is true, this line is executed, printing "Even".

else:
If the condition x % 2 == 0 is false (i.e., the number is odd), the program executes the code inside the else block.
print("Odd")

This line runs if the number is odd, printing "Odd".

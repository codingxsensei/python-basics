Explanation of the Code

Initialize the Number of Terms:
The variable num_terms is set to 10, which specifies how many terms of the Fibonacci series will be printed.

Define the First Two Terms:
Variables t1 and t2 are initialized to 0 and 1, respectively. These represent the first two terms of the Fibonacci series.

Print the First Two Terms:
The print() function is used to output the first two terms (t1 and t2). The end=" " parameter ensures that the subsequent terms are printed on the same line with a space in between.

Calculate the Remaining Terms:
A for loop is used to calculate and print the remaining terms of the series, starting from the 3rd term up to the num_terms-th term.

Inside the loop:
next_term is calculated as the sum of t1 and t2 (the previous two terms).
The next_term is printed, followed by a space.
The values of t1 and t2 are updated: t1 takes the value of t2, and t2 takes the value of next_term, ensuring the sequence progresses correctly.

End of the Loop:
The loop iterates until the desired number of terms is printed, completing the Fibonacci series.
